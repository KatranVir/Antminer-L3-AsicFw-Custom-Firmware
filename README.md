Advantages for using AsicFW?

    1. While, all other custom firmware’s are locking your device so you wont be able to move on to another firmware, our policy is “your device, you rights to choose the right firmware that suits you”. That’s why we are never going to lock your Antminer with “Signature Check” or by removing the “Shell Access” by any means.
    2. We are only using not more than ~1.8% for the dev-fee mining, others are using 3% even 10%.
    3. Much lower power consumption then other custom firmware’s.
